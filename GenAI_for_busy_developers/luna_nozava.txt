'''Luna Nozawa''' is a character on [[The Bold and the Beautiful]], portrayed by [[Lisa Yamada]].

Luna was introduced as the daughter of [[Poppy Nozawa]], the niece of Dr. [[Li Finnegan]], and the adoptive cousin of Dr. [[Finn Finnegan|Johnathan "Finn" Finnegan]].

== Background ==
Luna was born and raised by Poppy in The Bay area, Los Angeles, California. Luna and Poppy are self-described "hippies" and "free-spirits", unlike Li and her unnamed father who are said to be "very driven".

Luna is currently an Intern at [[Forrester Creations]]; secretly, she also assists [[Eric Forrester]] with his "grand finale" fashion line, at the [[Forrester Mansion]]. Due to the fallout caused by Finn's biological mother [[Sheila Carter]] and her past/present involvement with the [[Forrester family]] - primarily regarding Finn's and wife [[Steffy Forrester]]'s [[Episode 8774|attempted murder]] - all members of Luna's family have urged her to stay away and leave her internship.

== Storylines ==
Luna was introduced as she entered the family mansion with an armload of supplies for Eric and R.J. Forrester, to help create the new couture line they were working on in secret. When Eric asked partner [[Donna Logan]] why she hired Luna over all the other applicants, she had to admit she never looked at her resume, but when Luna pitched in on reception they had a nice talk and she made the decision. 

However, while Eric, Donna and R.J. felt they could trust Luna, the young woman then took a phone call from her mother, [[Poppy]], who was upset to learn she was in Los Angeles and warned her to stay away from the family. Poppy had made several further calls, ordering Luna to leave her internship, and reminding her about what happened to Li and Finn.

After Luna assured R.J. she would keep Ericâ€™s condition a secret, he insisted she tell him a secret of her own. She told him she was raised by her mother, who was a bit of a free spirit, though her grandfather and aunt are more driven. R.J. was immediately smitten with Luna, and has attempted to console her over the upset she presents regarding her family. Li found Luna in the Design Office at Forrester Creations, confused as to why she is in Los Angeles, and ordered that she resign. After complying, R.J. implores Luna to reconsider leaving the company, and they kiss intently.

After Luna was reunited with Finn, Luna tells him that the reason, she and her mother lost contact with him for years is because of Li. Then after Finn left, Li returned to the Design Office at Forrester Creations, R.J. implore Li to let Luna stay, but she refused. Then Luna asked R.J. to leave the room in order to speak to her aunt alone. After R.J. left, Luna blasted Li for the way she treated her mother and her for years, never invited her and her mother to Finn and Steffy's wedding, and never comforted her, when Finn was shot. Luna also informed Li, that fashion is her dream, since she was a child, she would know that, if Li would get to know Luna, and no one tells her, what she'll do with her own life, especially Li. 

== Crimes and Misdeeds ==

* Cheated on boyfriend [[R.J. Forrester]] with [[Zende Forrester Dominguez]], whilst under the influence of narcotics (2024).

== Maladies and Injuries ==
