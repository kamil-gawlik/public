Ridge is one of the show's original characters, and the first to ever appear on the show. His first scenes were at the start of [[Episode 1 (March 23, 1987)]]. The character has remained on the show since, with a 15-month hiatus between September 2012 and December 2013, due to being recast.

=='''<big>Biography</big>'''==
=='''Beginnings'''==
Ridge is the legal son of [[Eric Forrester]] and [[Stephanie Douglas]]. Ridge has four half-siblings Felicia, Thorne, Kristen and Angela from his mother and 2 half-siblings from his father, Nick and Diana. Angela died at birth, due to a severe disorder. Ridge was raised as the eldest and favorite Forrester son, especially by his mother Stephanie, but in reality he was the biological son of Massimo Marone to which Eric and Ridge were not aware of until 2001. 

== '''Caroline, Brooke, & Taylor''' ==
At the start of the series, Ridge is secretly dating [[Caroline Spencer Forrester|Caroline Spencer]]. Caroline's father, Bill Spencer, hears about Ridge's bad reputation with women and asks him not to see Caroline again. Later that evening, Ridge proposes to Caroline out of spite. Bill Spencer hires a private investigator to look into Ridge and see if he is mistreating Caroline. Bill tries to trust Ridge and calls the private investigator off, but the private investigator had already taken a picture of Ridge sleeping with a former fling, Alex Simpson in a hotel room having sex and sent it to Bill Spencer. On Caroline's wedding day, Bill tells Caroline what he has found. Caroline is heartbroken and angry at her father and decides to go on with the wedding anyway. As she is walking down the aisle, she faints and is taken to the hospital, leaving Ridge at the alter. After she is released, Ridge realizes he really does love her, but Caroline decides she needs to live on her own for awhile. Caroline does not tell anyone where she is staying, but when she needs money, she seeks the help of Ridge's sister [[Kristen Forrester]]. Ridge, however, suspects that Kristen knows where Caroline is and follows her one day to Caroline's apartment. Ridge wants to get Caroline back and decides to court her. However, after a very long time courting Caroline and her refusing to marry him just yet, he begins to feel that his needs are not being met. He begins dating Brooke while Caroline starts dating his brother, Thorne. Caroline ends up marrying Thorne in 1988. 

Ridge sleeps with Caroline as a prank and Thorne, upon learning of this and heavily medicated ends up shooting Ridge. Their mother, Stephanie, says that she was the one who shot Ridge but it was an accident because she was shooting at a prowler but the truth comes out eventually. During the time when everyone was trying to ensure that Thorne and Ridge did not remember the truth about the night of the shooting, Ridge had proposed to Brooke but they broke up after it was revealed that Ridge had written a letter to Caroline, wanting another chance but Brooke hid the letter . Ridge and Caroline reconciled and she divorced Thorne in 1989. Caroline married Ridge in 1990.Eric comforts Brooke at Ridge and Caroline s wedding and they start a relationship. Brooke becomes pregnant. Stephanie signes the divorce papers. Eric and Brooke get married.  

Caroline is diagnosed with leukemia. They begin counseling with Dr. Taylor Hayes.  

After Caroline died of Leiukemia, Ridge went for counseling lessons and that's where he met Taylor Hayes, a psychiatrist in 1990. She brings him comfort in his time of grieving and falls in love with her. He goes back and forth between Taylor and Brooke for decades to come, claiming to be in love with both, at different times throughout the next couple of decades.

Brooke was sad watching them exchange vows and Eric comforted her and she got pregnant but aborted it and Eric later left Stephanie for Brooke making Brooke and Stephanie, B&B's greatest rivals. Brooke and Eric then got pregnant again but Brooke didn't know whether it was of Ridge or Eric. The paternity test said Eric, but ex-fugitive [[Sheila Carter]] tampered with a second test to make it Ridge's so she could snag Eric from Stephanie. The child was Eric's and was named [[Bridget Forrester]], a combination of Brooke and Ridge because at the time of her birth, she thought Ridge was the father of her daughter, Bridget, not Eric . Brooke marries Eric in 1991.

Stephanie took Taylor in like a daughter and they've been good friends. Stephanie and Taylor both hated Brooke for breaking up their marriages. Taylor and Stephanie have fierce rivalries with Brooke. Taylor and Ridge had three children. Thomas (who was originally thought to be Thorne's), and two twins Steffy and Phoebe. Taylor named Thomas after Ridge and Taylor's romantic experience in St. Thomas and Steffy after Stephanie Forrester. 

Felicia, Thorne, and Ridge all banded together to take out [[Donna Logan]], Brooke's sister who tried to marry [[Eric Forrester]] and did. Ridge gave into Brooke before and many times throughout the years, both claiming that they were each other's destiny. Brooke also married Eric and Thorne too. Ridge didn't like Brooke and Eric's son Rick from the start. Rick dated Phoebe then kissed Steffy and slept with Taylor. At the time, Taylor was an alcoholic and got in many crazy relationships. Phoebe found out and was fighting with Rick driving in a car, and Rick crashed and killed Phoebe. Ridge came down to help her and was mad at Rick. Months later Rick began to date Steffy after their sorrow of Phoebe. Ridge was outraged when he found this out also. Stephanie also didn't like Rick dating Steffy saying he's been with practically everybody. Liam was sent to L.A. to find his father, Bill, and thought it was randomly Ridge. Ridge recognized that Liam made the tape at Hope's (Brooke's daughter) graduation of Brooke and Oliver having sex that Steffy exposed. Liam manipulated the tape to make it Steffy's fault and Ridge got angry. Stephanie held a vote to kick Brooke down to 49% of Forrester Creations  The people who voted her down were Macy, Eric, Stephanie, Ridge, and Thorne. Taylor was not there. Ridge now lives in Paris, France. Ridge surprisingly didn't show up for his mother's funeral or Steffy's second wedding to Liam. Steffy recently ended her marriage to Liam after suffering a miscarriage and receiving news that she cannot have children as a result, which resulted in her moving to Paris to be with her father.

Massimo Marone came to town in 2001, to woo Ridge's mother Stephanie. Not too long after he came to town, Ridge got cut bad and went to the hospital. Ridge's and Eric's blood samples made it clear that Eric and Ridge could not be father and son. Ridge later found out Massimo was his father. Eric was devastated but still favored Ridge over his other children. By this time [[Nick Marone]], Massimo's other son and Ridge's half-brother were fighting over Brooke's affections. Ridge and Brooke during one marriage had a honeymoon in South Africa and were kidnapped by thugs hired by ex-fugitive Sheila Carter with Nick for Massimo's gold. Ridge fought for Brooke, fell in a furnace and was thought to be dead. Nick and Brooke then got pregnant and Ridge returned. Brooke didn't know who the father was. It was Nick's child but Brooke ended up having a miscarriage. 

=='''Ridge's Return'''==
Ridge makes his dramatic return to Los Angeles in December 2013 showing up at the Forrester mansion and seeing Eric for the first time in over a year. Ridge and Eric have a heartfelt reunion where Eric updates Ridge on what has happened in the past year he was gone. Ridge also expresses his guilt that he wasn't there for his mother during her final moments, but Eric assured Ridge that Stephanie loved Ridge no matter what. Eric offers a room for Ridge at the mansion which Ridge accepts and reveals the reason why he returned: to reunite with Brooke, completely unaware that during his absence, she had an affair with Bill who was married at the time to her sister, Katie. Ridge and Katie shared a love for poetry and went to the park with R.J. and Will. He talked to Katie about it and began to regularly support her building an emotional bond. Liam Spencer walked in on them close and almost kissing when Katie called him over. Katie told Ridge to marry Brooke and that she'd be alright. Liam encouraged Katie to go with her gut but she made the points that she didn't want to be a Brooke and they always end up with each other. Brooke told Katie that her and Ridge are getting married. Brooke then asked Katie to be their matron of honor and with Brooke's constant pushing, Katie agreed.

At Brooke and Ridge's marriage, [[Carter Walton]], found a poem he thought represented Ridge and Brooke's relationship which happened to be Ridge and Katie's favorite poem, "Love's Philosophy" and Katie fainted to the ground. Later, Katie told Ridge that she faked it because she couldn't let him marry her sister. When Hope found out about her aunt and Ridge's feelings for each other, she said she would take her mom with her and Wyatt to Paris to give them time to sort things out. But Ridge and Katie shared a passionate kiss, revealing their love for each other and cuddling and making out. When Brooke returned, the two confessed everything to a skeptical and angry Brooke. A teary-eyed Brooke later tried to win back Ridge after getting support from Donna, but Ridge admits that his heart is with Katie now, and he leaves Brooke to go home to Katie, where they make love for the first time.

Ridge decided to take over Forrester again by firing Oliver because of his below average shots and tried to kick Rick out of his presidency. Ridge felt Hope For The Future is nothing like Couture. Eric decided to side with Rick after Brooke medlled with the situation and Oliver was rehired. Eric made Ridge and Brooke both co-vice presidents of the company. Eric told Ridge that is he left Katie and went back to Brooke, he can take over his place as CEO. Ridge and Katie were having sex when ridge told her about this. Katie was shocked because she thought that Eric liked her but told him to do it for the position. Ridge decided not to. Bill went to Brooke's and let her know that he has been patient with her and won't take no for an answer. The two had sex and were in love yet again. Brooke decided to call Katie and let her know that her and Bill are back together as Katie and Ridge were having sex. Katie thought Brooke did this to make Katie jealous or something. Katie went to Eric's office to discuss this. Eric told her that they work well together and it's a business decision. Katie told Eric that she thinks it's more than that and this is because he wants Ridge with Brooke as Brooke listened closely. Eric left as Brooke came in and Katie blasted Brooke briefly before leaving.

After Katie lost the company, Ridge proposed to her Katie a ribbon. When Brooke came over to Katie's, she asked her what is that. Katie rubbed it in Brooke's face and told her that Ridge and her are getting married. Bill then proposed to Brooke and promised a trip to Abu Dhabi and to get married. Donna told this to Katie. Katie was fine with that but Ridge didn't want Bill raising R.J. or marrying Brooke. Before Bill and Brooke left, Ridge told Brooke not to marry Bill. Brooke left with Bill. Bill then proposed to Brooke and promised a trip to Abu Dhabi and Dubai to get married. Donna told this to Katie. Katie was fine with that but Ridge didn't want Bill raising R.J. or marrying Brooke. Before Bill and Brooke left, Ridge told Brooke not to marry Bill. Brooke left with Bill. Bill and Brooke left for Abu Dhabi and Dubai. At a Forrester meeting, Ridge disliked Quinn and Wyatt's jewelry and was distressed about Bill and Brooke. Quinn sent some jewelry photos and the picture of Bill and her to Ridge. Quinn told Ridge that they had an affair even though it really wasn't an "affair". Before leaving, Ridge told Eric who was shocked. Eric confronted Quinn about this because he thought she hated Bill. Quinn claimed she was lonely and "what you and I had, well that's not really relevant right now." Ridge left for the Middle East and sent called Katie telling her about it and sent her Quinn's picture. Katie confronted Quinn and was upset that Quinn was the reason her fiance was half way around the world with her sister. Just after Bill and Brooke exchanged their vows, Ridge showed up to break them up. After Bill and Brooke said their "I-Do's", Ridge arrives and yells" Logan." Ridge shows them the picture which shocks Brooke. Ridge punches Bill to the ground and ran off with Brooke pulling her by the hand. Ridge took Brooke into the helicopter, Bill nodded to the pilot. The chopper flew up when Bill said into his walkee-talkee "Cool him off." The pilot swayed the chopper as Ridge felt his arm and on the sleeve had a Spencer Publications symbol and a black face turned around as Ridge recognized Justin Barber to be the pilot. Ridge fell into the Persian Gulf. Brooke was freaking out. Katie and Eric heard the news and flew to Dubai. Thorne was later called to show up. Thorne supported Katie who was engaged to Ridge. Bill told Justin not to tell anybody and Justin claimed who would he tell and why would he. Word got out and after Liam made the accusation that Quinn may be the reason Ridge is dead. Rick fired Quinn and Wyatt from the company. Everybody thought Ridge was dead when Brooke found Ridge walking alone on the beach. Katie found Brooke and Ridge hugging. At first Ridge couldn't remember Katie that well. He had suffered some amnesia. After Katie recited their poem, he spoke the last line and remembered her. Back in L.A., the Forresters held a welcoming back party for Ridge and Katie didn't want to rush him but wanted to get married and start where they left off.

== '''Working with Caroline, cheating on Katie''' ==
When Ridge finds himself feeling uninspired and can't seem to design anything, Caroline, who has always idolized Ridge as a designer, offers to help him, which angers Rick because of his own personal hatred for Ridge. However, Caroline gets her chance to work with her idol, which begins to put a strain on her marriage. Maya noticed that Caroline and Ridge were working closely together on a couture line behind closed doors not letting anybody in, hoping there was something more. She told Rick she saw them hugging, but he had faith in Caroline and denied it. Maya tried to bring up the memories they shared, but Rick continued to stay faithful to his wife. Ever since Bill dumped Ridge into the Persian Gulf during an altercation at Bill and Brooke's wedding attempt, Ridge lost his ability to draw. He could coarse Caroline's hand and draw perfectly though. Caroline began getting frustrated with Ridge's perfectionist ways and asked why couldn't he do it himself but realized he can't. He admit to it and made Caroline promise that she wouldn't tell anybody, not even Rick. Katie walks in on them working closely and they explain their partnership. Katie begins to feel uncomfortable and discusses this with Rick who is also secretly a bit uncomfortable. Rick got angry that Ridge is taking credit for Caroline's designs but Caroline insisted she's happy to help him. Rick brought this up to Eric who decided to resign from CEO and will give his position to either Rick or Ridge. He asked Caroline who he should give it to but she didn't have an answer. Caroline expressed her romantic feelings to Ridge, who admit he has a crush on her too and kissed her. However, Caroline ends up feeling very guilty over the kiss due to her knowing how much Rick hates Ridge and how devestated he would be if he found out. However, the duo are exposed by [[Maya Avant]] after Eric had just named Ridge CEO of Forrester Creations. Rick is devestated and leaves in a rage. Ridge's relationship with Katie is also affected by what happened with Caroline, and despite their best efforts, Katie can't get past what Ridge has done and breaks off the engagement.

Eric signed the paper to give Rick irrevocable control. Rick was preaching to everybody in the meeting how he can do this for a year while Eric is away, with the help of a loyal woman by his side. Caroline thought Rick was talking about her when Rick called Maya in an announced that he is still with Maya. Rick and Maya moved into the Forrester Mansion while Eric was briefly away and Maya kicked Ivy and Aly out for a day to have some privacy. Rick also took down stephanie's portrait and hung up a portrait of Maya. Maya was a little nervous thinking how people would react but Rick insisted. The Forresters were offended by Rick's actions especially Stephanie's sister, Pamela Douglas. Ivy and Aly agreed that Rick's just doing this to get back at Caroline and that he still loves her. In a Forrester meeting, Rick was bothered by the success of Caroline and Ridge's art, he even turned down Aly's great design in shoes. Rick dismissed everybody and threatened to fire Caroline and Ivy. Liam Spencer rushed in and punched Rick to the floor! Rick started cracking up but let them keep their jobs.

Brooke returned to L.A. from Milan only to find Maya home in Brooke's lingerie from the Brooke's Bedroom line.Maya welcomed her in and put a red robe on. Brooke was shocked to see Maya's portrait on the wall in place of Stephanie's. Brooke was appalled and uninformed. Maya stated it's only temporary until Eric comes back. Maya questioned if Rick has told her what's going on and Brooke denied it. Maya stated Caroline turned to someones else. Brooke was astonished and at first she wanted Rick to tell her the story but then she blurted out it was Ridge. Maya went up stairs to change and tried to be polite with Brooke.

Rick filed divorce papers and wanted to get rid of Stephanie's gun too. The lawyer forgot to take it with him at Forrester, so Rick took a stroll with it, and found Caroline and Ridge on top of each other, making out, in an office. Rick cracked open the door and fired gun shots at the wall. Ridge sprung up and Rick questioned both of them. Ridge took the gun away from Rick and emptied the bullets. Pam, Charlie, and Carter rushed over hearing gun shots. They were surprised to find out that Rick shot them. Rick still doesn't want Ridge with his wife, but Ridge stated that he doesn't want her anymore. Ridge was going to call Lieutenant Baker to file a report but Caroline convinced him otherwise. Rick returned to the Forrester Mansion to see his mother, Brooke Logan, back talking to Maya. Maya informed Brooke about Caroline and Ridge's affair. Rick stated gunshots were shot at the office. Brooke and Maya were shocked. Rick stated he shot them at Ridge and Caroline. Brooke called Ridge and was concerned. Brooke was on Rick's side, shocked about Ridge and Caroline's affair. Ridge stated they'll have this conversation another time. Caroline signed the divorce papers without even reading them over. Ridge suggested running away with her and starting their own company.

Brooke arrived at Forrester Creations trying to control everybody by threatening to fire Ridge and insisting that Caroline and Rick work their marriage out of his relationship with Maya is over. However, Brooke's theory didn't work and Rick remained with Maya as well as Caroline remained with Ridge. Ridge and Caroline moved into an apartment together. Ridge decided to paint a portrait of her with her holding a sheet covering up her privates. After he was done, she stated she thought he meant he wanted to paint her and they began painting each others bodies. Brooke texted Ridge wanting to talk to him in person at the Logan Mansion. Ridge rushed over there and found Brooke in undergarments and an unbuttoned robe. Brooke explained she wanted to be with him and they have so much history. Ridge explained he's with Caroline and Brooke called their relationship a fling. Brooke asked him to look at her and tell her she's not in love. Ridge stated he is in love which Brooke thought was her but he stated he's in love with Caroline and left.  

After Brooke and Eric kept favoring Rick about his position, Ridge decided to quit, which hurt Eric because he's his son and greatest asset to Forrester. Ridge told Carter he quit and right when Ridge was fleeing out the door, Carter stopped him to tell him something important. Carter blurted out to Ridge that Maya is transgender. Ridge was shocked and actually felt bad for Little Ricky. Ridge reasked for his job back and then told Eric and Brooke who Maya really is. Eric and Brooke were amazed and Eric wouldn't let Ridge humiliate Rick like that. Brooke appointed herself the one to tell Rick. Brooke confronted Maya about her and Rick's honesty and her not being who she really is. Brooke called her Myron and stated she knows. Maya was devastated and asked who told Brooke and she was shocked to hear it was Ridge. Maya stated she'll tell Rick when he proposes which they agreed they both know is soon. Brooke insisted Maya wouldn't humiliate him like that, down on one knee, to tell him. Maya insisted she won't accept unless he accepts all of her.

Rick ended up at the Forrester Mansion safely after his car crash trying to catch up with an upset Maya after she told him her secret in [[Big Bear Cabin]] and [[Bill Spencer Jr.]] published her secret by Nicole telling Wyatt. Rick was adamant about having to talk to her but Brooke insisted he rested up and healed. Maya sent an online resignation to Forrester which Ridge rubbed in his face. Ridge stated he should be CEO of Forrester and Rick attacked him. Ridge tried to convinced Eric to make him CEO while Rick did the same. Rick stated Ridge stole both of their wives and he should believe in him because of the profits and leadership. Eric stated his behavior hasn't been good and he should take some time off, maybe go back to Paris.

Caroline returned to L.A. with Ridge wheeling her in a wheelchair after she got hit by a car in New York. Ridge promised to take care of her. Caroline was shocked to hear her uncle Bill published the true story about Maya being transgendered.

After Eric wouldn't appoint Ridge as CEO, Ridge called Steffy on the phone to meet him at Forrester. Steffy arrived informed that Maya is transgender and Eric won't remove Rick as CEO. Ridge insisted he needed Steffy and him to be a team to take over Forrester and she agreed. Ridge insisted this is bigger than her getting Liam back and him getting CEO. Rick arrived in his office giving them a hard time. Ridge called Liam to meet him at Forrester. Liam was happy to see Steffy and she was also pleased. Ridge convinced Liam to use Steffy's, Thomas's, Bill's controlled by Liam, and Thomas's to overpower Eric. Steffy stated there are no conditions this time. Liam agreed and Ridge insisted to Eric that they're taking over while Eric insisted he's in charge which Ridge stated he's in charge now. Ridge was the new CEO, with Steffy president, and Liam vice president, which he is also at Spencer's. Steffy and Liam agreed they would make a great team. Liam stated Steffy's change like a cool mountain stream. They remembered their time in Aspen by a stream. Steffy stated she is not afraid to state that she loves him and will always love him with Ivy overhearing.

Nicole stated she needed to speak to Rick privately. Rick explained he couldn't get the chance to answer because his car crashed. Nicole told him that Maya's at her old apartment at Dayzee's. Rick dressed up as a waiter in the same tie dye shirt asking Maya for her order. Rick explained the story to Maya and that he still loves her. Maya claims she was leaving town but Rick convinced her to stay while he had a business meeting to go to. Rick and Eric were getting nervous that Steffy, Ridge, and Liam were going to use Ridge's, Steffy's, Thomas's, and Bill's shares to take over Forrester Creations. Rick came to Bill to make a business proposition. Rick tried convincing Bill to use his shares to his and Eric's advantage and he'll have more control around the company. In the middle of the meeting in Rick's office, Bill barged in explaining their deal and his predicament. Bill explained he doesn't like the way Ridge treats him. Bill asked Ridge and Rick to convince him why he should take their side. Bill commended Liam for protecting Caroline and Ivy. Ultimately, Bill chose to side with Rick under one condition, Maya, the face of Forrester Creations, has to go. Rick punched Bill and withdrew from the deal. Ridge became the new CEO with Steffy president and Liam vice president. Rick explained to Maya the news and that all that matter's is that they're still together.

Maya returns to the Forrester Mansion and Rick persuades her to stay. Ridge barges in, in the middle of their kiss, to state that Forrester needs her. Maya's supporters online believe that Forrester Creations forced her to leave the company. Ridge asked her to come back and offered her the lead model position. Maya stated she'd love to work as lead model at Forrester again under one condition, that Rick can come back too. Ridge allowed Rick to run International from Los Angeles and Maya to return as lead model.

Pam welcomed [[Zende Dominguez]] to the company and directed him towards his uncle Ridge. Ridge was ecstatic to see him again and was happy to hear he's applying for an internship. During the internship meeting, Ridge questioned why [[Nicole Avant]] is here. Nicole stated she's applying as an intern and gave him her resume. She apologized for acting like a big shot around here. Nicole convinced Ridge to hire her and her new friend, Zende. Ridge hired all of them five interns. Ridge sent love to his mom when Nicole noticed they must know each other. Ridge stated Zende's mother, Kristen, is his sister, making Zende his nephew. Nicole was amazed Zende didn't tell her he's a Forrester. At the same time, Zende never knew Nicole is Maya's little sister.

Ridge and Steffy ended [[Hope For The Future]] and started a new Forrester line called [[California Freedom]] which involves the same morals of HFTF but encourages women to be free with their bodies and involves lingerie and swimwear. The lead lingerie model was going to be Steffy. [[Aly Forrester]] was strongly resentful and started arguments, showing hatred towards Steffy and Maya in particular. Everybody ignored Aly and Steffy suggested Aly leaving for Paris. Ridge stated he said Aly can stay here if she behaves. Ridge chose Maya to be the lead model for the line which made Rick and Maya happy.

=='''Aly's Death and Thomas's Return'''==
Ridge and Caroline attended Aly's funeral who was killed by Steffy in self-defense. Thomas returned to L.A. to attend the funeral who hugged Ridge. Ridge made a rude lecture bashing everybody for not preventing Aly from going off the rails which angered Thorne especially.

After the funeral, Thomas explained to Ridge and Caroline that he will be staying permanently in L.A. He asked Ridge for a job at Forrester Creations but Ridge kept giving him a hard time, stating there are no executive positions available and every employee has to earn their job. Thomas stated he actually wants to be part of the design team. Thomas explained with Ridge being CEO, he has many responsibilities and he prefers designing over crunching numbers. Ridge agreed to make him part of the design team.

Caroline saw Thomas working out and shirtless and Thomas joked with her about her relationship with his dad and asked how it all started. Thomas drew a portrait of Caroline.

Caroline got emotional when her divorce from Rick became finalized. She just realized that she had so many goals and dreams she planned that ended. Caroline explained to Ridge she didn't expect their relationship but enjoys it. Caroline explained the one think she really wants is to be a mother. She began crying about this and asked Ridge if he'd have a baby with her. Ridge said no and Caroline said if it's between a baby and him, she'll choose him every time.

Ivy blackmails Thomas into convincing Ridge to make her the new face of Forrester or Steffy goes to prison with a video she recorded of Steffy hitting Aly with a tire iron.

At the conference, Ridge was leaning on choosing Steffy when Ivy stated she'd like to give it a shot. Steffy and Ridge were initially concerned but Wyatt backed her up and Thomas spoke up and agreed that Ivy would be better because people are still talking about the incident with Aly. Steffy is angry with Thomas and he informed her about the blackmail and the video.

Brooke informs Thomas that Ridge is going to decide whether or not he'll have a child with Caroline. Ridge tells Caroline she'll be a wonderful mother and he wants her to raise her child. But not with him. He says the man she'll have a child with is lucky. Caroline is devastated and bursts out crying and leaves Ridge's apartment. Caroline rents her own apartment.

Caroline questions whether she can get paternity results but the doctor states it's to early in the pregnancy to tell. Caroline realizes it's Thomas's child and is distraught. Caroline returns home to Ridge who insists on telling her some big news. Caroline asks if it can wait because it's really important but Ridge insists. Ridge informs Caroline about the vasectomy he had done last year and he had been planning to get it reversed as a surprise. Turns out, the vasectomy cannot be undone, so he can't be the father to her baby. Caroline is devastated and Ridge feels empathetic. Ridge asks what she wanted to tell him. Caroline explains that on the night they broke up, a friend comforted her in her apartment. She admits to using some of Pam's pills she picked up, which she was meaning to return, mixed with some alcohol, which he had been drinking as well. Caroline admits that she fell asleep and woke up and was informed they slept together. Ridge is angry and asks whether he took advantage of her but Caroline insists otherwise. Ridge asks about this guy and Caroline reveals his name to be Thomas. Ridge asks if it's his son and Caroline confirms it to be the one. Ridge is angry and asks what Thomas is to her, a friend, more than a friend, and Caroline bursted out that he's the father of her baby. Ridge is furious and throws a vase. Caroline is crying and sorry and Ridge is heartbroken that his son would do this to him. Caroline and Ridge feel their relationship is over when Ridge suggests raising her baby as their own without telling Thomas. Caroline was indecisive at first but soon after agreed.

Thomas unhappily went off to Paris. Thomas returned shortly after. Steffy convinced Ridge to give Thomas his job back as co-designer with Caroline. Thomas walks in on Caroline and Ridge's sonogram at the hospital. He claims he was there for a check up and happened to see them here.

Therefore, Brooke and Ridge allow him to move back into the Forrester Mansion. However, from the start, RJ encourages his parents to get back together for their family. Brooke informs RJ that she's currently engaged to Bill, much to RJ's dismay. However, the three of them begin to bond through having family dinners and looking through photo albums. Brooke and Ridge start to feel that sentimental spark again. RJ encourages Ridge to try to woo Brooke back for their family. Ridge tries to win back Brooke but Brooke keeps declining.

After the Forrester family learns about Eric's new relationship with Quinn, they are very disapproving. Eric and Quinn plan to get married at the Forrester Mansion in front of their friends and family. They invite all of his family to attend however the only one who showed up was Ivy. Eric feels devastated but nevertheless marries Quinn. They get married with Perez Hilton as their officiate. He goes to his office after his family ask him to meet him there and they tell him that they want to use the company's morality clause against him.

Eric arrives in his office upset at his whole family already for them not attending his wedding to Quinn. The Forresters try to explain that they were doing this for his own good and Quinn is a danger to the family. Eric calls everybody out on the immoral things they've done but reminds them that he forgave them. After getting so upset, Eric collapses on the floor. The family goes to see Eric in the hospital, but he slips into a coma.

At Forrester Creations, Liam supports Steffy, who is upset about the situation with Eric. She gets to thinking, and they start searching for the marriage certificate. Once they find it in an envelope, Steffy is surprised that Eric didn't sign the marriage license. Steffy tells Liam that Ridge is on his way and Quinn may not be Mrs. Forrester after all. In the hall, Carter chats with Pam about the stress of waiting. Carter is concerned that things are going to get more difficult, before they get better. In the office, Ridge arrives and Steffy shows him the unsigned, non filed marriage certificate. Liam pipes up, “Legally speaking, Quinn can’t be Mrs. Eric Forrester.” Ridge notes he has Eric’s power-of-attorney, and with this news, he can make sure Quinn doesn’t hurt the company or their family. Once alone, Liam and Steffy speculate on what Ridge will do next. Liam reflects on the misery Quinn has caused over the past several years and they embrace.

Steffy decides to fix things with Wyatt and move back in. Wyatt overhears Steffy and Ridge's plan to remove Eric from the position of CEO by using Ridge as power-of-attorney and is appalled. Steffy defends their reason of protecting the family but Wyatt breaks up with her. Quinn rushes to his hospital room to see her husband, but the doctor tells her that only the immediate family is allowed to visit. The Forresters try to tell Quinn that she is not legally married to Eric but Quinn demands to see her husband anyway. Quinn has a heart-to-heart with Eric, causing his finger to move and he starts to wake up. Once Eric is back at the Forrester Mansion, he signs the marriage license. However Ridge is able to name himself CEO with Steffy as President.

=='''Affair with Quinn'''==
Quinn is in charge of orchestrating the Forrester fashion show. She wants Steffy to wear the showstopper dress which is exactly identical to all the other dresses, just with the jewelry different, to let the jewelry shine. Steffy refuses to show defiance of Quinn. Quinn decides to wear the showstopper, with Ivy being the announcer. Ridge is forced to approach her on stage and give a speech. Although, the Forresters were appalled by the showstopper, it was received with instant acclaim, proving it to be a successful move.

Ridge hides in the bushes at the Forrester Mansion, lurking to see whether Quinn is up to no good. He unintentionally finds Quinn naked, trying out the backyard shower she bought as a surprise for Eric. Quinn hears Ridge rustling in the bushes and asks for whoever that is to reveal themselves. Ridge reveals himself and explains what he was doing there. Meanwhile, Quinn is extremely comfortable and not ashamed at all, and begins flirting with Ridge, making light of him seeing her naked. Ridge apologizes again and leaves the yard.

Quinn offers to model some designs for Ridge while he compliments the outfit and puts jewelry on her. Quinn makes quite a few innuendos about the incident. Ridge realizes Quinn seems attracted to him after that and is seemingly flirting with him. Ridge conspires to steal Quinn away from Eric, to get Quinn out of them company. Quinn twists her ankle and Ridge offers to rub it for her. Quinn thanks him but assumes it just needs some heat, so she roams over to the steam room. Ridge accompanies her and tells her to close her eyes while he massages her feet. Ridge works his way up to her knee, when Quinn feels uncomfortable and dashes out.  Outside the steam room, Ivy eavesdrops on Quinn and Ridge debate who's playing games and about her naked teasing.

Eric suggests that Ridge and Quinn go on a business trip to San Francisco together to bond and get over their feud. Quinn is hesitant and insecure but Eric resists. Eric calls and books two rooms for Quinn and Ridge. Ridge calls them back and tells the receptionist to make it one room. Quinn and Ridge get to their room and Quinn immediately realizes what Ridge is doing. Quinn explains to Ridge that he hates her so much that he's trying to seduce her away from his own father. Quinn refuses to fall victim to him like all the other women that did. Quinn opens up to Ridge about her history with men and why she's so complicated. Ridge empathizes with her and tells her the reason Eric fell for her was because he can see who she really is, the woman she's hiding from the world, who is beautiful and amazing. Quinn and Ridge embrace and share a kiss, but then both found it as wrong and decided against doing it again.

At this point in time, Ridge was engaged to Brooke, but had revealed as much to her as that he wanted to rid the family and his father of Quinn. However, his plan seemed to have taken a turn for the better. He saw that Quinn was changed woman, and her time with Eric has done this to her. Ridge confuses everybody by upholding Quinn, her feelings and her designs. This stuns everybody, but makes Eric very pleased. However, nobody knew of Ridge's ulterior motives.

Ridge and Quinn kissed while Eric was away on business, and again after Zende and Nicole's wedding reception - which was caught by Ivy, who slapped Quinn and told her off for betraying her grandfather. Charlie also had suspicions after seeing them together at the wedding and around Forrester Creations, which fell on Pam's deaf ears. In all of this, though, the largest suspicions came from Katie, whom not only lived next door but also had a crush on Eric.

Katie watched the two from afar and told Brooke of her suspicions, which she did not believe. On the plane to Australia, Quinn and Ridge held hands, which Katie also saw, and reported to Brooke, which the reply came through as her being nuts. After Liam and Steffy's wedding reception on Manly Beach, Quinn and Ridge both went for walks, and ran into one another. Quinn discussed how happy Liam and Steffy are, and that thanks to Eric, she could not be happier either. Ridge agrees that he could not want anyone better for his father. Ridge and Quinn kiss once again, but it was caught by Brooke, whom had gone to join Ridge.

Brooke confronted the two and told Quinn off, while Ridge escaped. After a spar of words and accusations, Brooke set off to tell Eric. Quinn followed. After reaching Eric's apartment, Brooke told him that she needs to have a word with him, and Quinn said the same. Eric needed some time to think, and during this time, Ridge, Quinn, and Brooke met in a room to discuss what had happened and what was to be told. They settled on an agreement - as long as there is no more interaction between Ridge and Quinn, the secret is to be kept from Eric. However Brooke calls off their and stays in Australia. 

Returning home from Australia, Katie had words with both Ridge and Quinn. She had been told by Brooke and received an apology for disbelief with it. Katie found that this gives her control over Ridge and Quinn, ordering Quinn around, for whatever tasks get left unfilled will result in her husband knowing of the secret. Ridge is shocked when Brooke tells him that Bill and her are getting married. Ridge tries to stop Brooke from marrying Bill, but Brooke reminds Ridge that Bill would never let her down or betray her like he did. Ridge his heartbroken that Brooke decided to married Bill.

== '''Shots Fired At Quinn''' ==
In June 2017, shots had been fired at Quinn, on the Forrester Mansion porch. The immediate suspect was Katie, whom had already holstered a gun at Quinn as a sign of threat, holding the secret of her affair with Ridge. Katie was taken into custody and pleaded innocent, to which she also proved herself being.

Quinn decided to pay Katie another visit, but nobody was home. Quinn sees a woman trying to escape the house without being noticed. Quinn asked who she is. She tells Quinn she is Sheila, an old friend of the Logans. Quinn dismisses this as she had never heard of her, but then told this to Eric at home, who asked if it was Sheila Carter - his ex-wife. If so, Eric warned Quinn to stay well away, as Sheila is trouble.

Coming home after being interrogated about the attempted murder of Quinn, Katie finds Sheila in her home. She is immediately frightened and threatens to call the police, but Sheila assures her that she is a changed woman after serving time, and that she should put in some good word for her within the Forresters. Katie messages Eric without Sheila seeing, to which Eric rushes to the scene, questions Sheila's intentions (to which he got the same answers), and proceeds to call Lt. Baker, claiming to have found the shooter. Sheila was taken into custody.

Sheila is interrogated at the police station, and pleads to have known nothing of a shooting. She tries to convince Baker and Eric of her innocence, and the same lines of how her involvement with the Forresters (and the time she had served) has changed her for the better. However, given her track record, and the fact that she had already violated a restraining order from Eric, Sheila was arrested and taken away.

It turns out Sheila was, however, telling the truth. Shots were fired again at Quinn while Sheila was away. Quinn sees them and rushes inside, and hides. Enter a seemingly drunken Deacon Sharpe, whom had arrived after a long disappearance. Quinn tells him to hide, but Deacon reassures her and says that he can deal with them. He calls 911. Quinn thanks him, but Deacon, going for Eric's tequila, goes off at Quinn as to how she can get everything she wants - and leaving him with nothing. He reverts back to being shoved off a cliff, then saving Quinn and housing her, and then her mistreating him and finding solace with Eric. Quinn and Deacon spar and argue for a period, but Quinn is mainly focused on her safety. She asks Deacon to see his phone and check how long it had been since the police called. Deacon reaches into his pocket and grabs a pistol, saying that they both know he faked that call.

Deacon continues his ranting at Quinn while holstering his gun at her, saying that he was the one shooting her, as she deserves not to live knowing she had mistreated him. Quinn fears further for her life, but Katie finds Quinn in this situation while spying from afar with her telescope. Katie calls Ridge, whom had been called to Quinn's guard since the shooting first occurred. Ridge rushes to the scene right in the nick of time, knocks Deacon unconscious and grabs the gun. He then goes to comfort Quinn, as her hero.

Deacon wakes up after Ridge had called the police. Deacon remembers nothing of the incident, however, was told all about it. Deacon explained he is even broker than before and had reverted back to alcoholism. Deacon asked Quinn for money, a place to live, and, preferably, his life back. Quinn said that Deacon tried to kill her, refusing to, before the police and Eric arrive to take him away.

Brooke, Bill and Wyatt were called for comfort and further concern, and Katie came to explain it was her that called Ridge, to which Quinn was grateful. She then proceeded to walk outside, knowing the shooter was gone. Eric got a call from Lt. Baker, saying that Deacon was in the process of being booked, and that Sheila was innocent - however, she had broken the restraining order. Eric had the choice whether or not to continue with the charges, to which he decided not to.

Quinn goes out on the porch again, and Ridge follows. They talk, and Quinn thanks him for protecting her. She then tells him she is falling in love with him, to which he answers back. They share a passionate moment.

Ridge had no defense when Sheila put the pieces together about him and Quinn and went to Eric. Ridge placed the blame on himself and was dismayed to learn that Eric might have taken off with Sheila. Ridge couldn't believe it when Steffy revealed she'd gotten Liam to track Eric's cell phone, then shot Sheila thinking Sheila had a gun in her purse. Steffy question's Ridge on why Eric took off. Ridge comes clean to Steffy about Quinn and himself. Steffy is furious at both her father and Quinn for breaking her grandfather's heart.

Ridge went to Eric and admitted he'd always been in competition with him, suggesting he'd wooed Quinn to get back at Eric because he'd made him co-CEO under Steffy -- and because he could. Ridge tearfully accepted it when Eric disowned him.

Ridge got stuck in the Forrester elevator with Quinn and admitted he missed their friendship, not knowing that Sheila had trapped them there trying to get an incriminating photo of them in a clinch. Later, Ridge felt his luck changing when Eric came to him and admitted he'd turned his back on Ridge to hurt him, which led to a reconciliation; also, Ridge learned that Brooke had left Bill -- though she wouldn't say why, Ridge offered Brooke his friendship, hopeful that Brooke might find her way back to him after all. Ridge was pleased when most of the guests at the Thanksgiving table deemed him and Brooke destiny.

=='''Thorne's Return and His Engagement to Brooke'''==
On the heels of Ridge proposing to Brooke once more, and her accepting, Thorne makes the decision to return to Los Angeles completely, moving home from Paris. He is greeted with open arms, from all except Ridge, whom holds grudges brewed over several years of "mistreatment". The first person Thorne sets his focus towards is Brooke, whom he was once married to but ultimately lost to Ridge. This was caught onto quickly by Ridge, whom confronted and threatened Thorne on a number of occasions, leading Thorne to shove him to the ground, stopping him from being called the degrading "little brother" which Ridge has called him his entire life, and reminding Ridge of his biological paternity - substituting "little brother" for "half-brother". While Brooke accepted Thorne's several kisses and close encounters, she constantly reminded him of her commitment to her husband, Ridge, and that what they had was in the past, where it will remain. Brooke and Ridge blissfully wed in the [[Forrester Mansion]].

== '''Katie Logan Forrester vs. Bill Spencer for Will Spencer's Custody''' ==
After many weeks, Katie recalls her concerns of Bill's sole-custody threats against Will to Thorne, whom encourages her to pursue it for herself, as Bill has been a negligent father to all of his children - by threatening Wyatt and his past relationship with Katie, almost killing Liam Spencer in destroying the Spectra Fashions building and stalking his wife, Steffy Forrester, and avoiding visitation with Will in amongst. After much consideration, Katie opens a custody case with the Family Court, to be administered by Judge Craig McMullen - a college friend of Ridge's. Ridge pays his friend a visit, explaining the situation, and reminding McMullen of the deed Ridge granted him - a substantial payment to pursue his career in law. Ridge uses this as leverage towards gaining Katie full custody of Will, to which McMullen takes into consideration, and, after a substantial hearing supported by (for Katie) Thorne and Liam, and (for Bill) Brooke and Wyatt, McMullen gives in to Ridge's pressuring demands by issuing Katie full custody of Will.

Bill is brought down by this, but is comforted by Brooke - seemingly, the only person ultimately on his side. Ridge, however, beams with glee at the functionality of his plan. This did not take long for several people to notice, and before long, almost all key players towards Katie gaining full custody of Will were aware - some pleased, and some not, and resulting in McMullen being questioned by both Brooke and Katie, to which he refused to speak about.  

Brooke then starts to get suspicious of judge McMullen, and investigates him. When Ridge goes to the bathroom she see's his burner phone and see's McMullen's contact. Brooke learns about Ridge and McMullen's history and that Ridge bribed him into giving full custody to Katie. Brooke furiously confronts her husband on committing a crime and can potentially get him arrested. Also for having  Bill loose his rights as a father. Ridge express no remorse and justified what he did. Brooke call Ridge out for wanting to get back a Bill for sleeping with Steffy. Brooke warns Ridge that Bill will get revenge on him if he finds out. However Brooke decides to not tell Bill. 

Bill spoke to Katie about the outcome, pleading for a second chance, to which she did not accept under any terms.  However after Brooke tells Katie about Ridge and judge McMullen, she decides to give joint custody to Bill again. 

After learning of this pestering, Thorne and Ridge confronted Bill at his home and warned him to keep away from Katie and Will, to which a brawl ensued, resulting in Ridge throwing Bill off of his balcony. Bill was admitted to hospital in a coma, to where Brooke revealed the outcome of the case to Bill. To confirm this, Bill set up Ridge and McMullen to meet in the Forrester Creations parking lot, whilst himself and Justin are parked nearby with radar equipment to spy on their conversation. Ridge and McMullen spoke about the plan, to which McMullen expressed his deep regret in following with. Bill and Justin were noticed by Ridge, who followed them to Spencer Publications, and confronted Bill over what he was doing. Bill told Ridge that he now knows about what has happened - but instead of pursuing this further, he believes that he is a "changed man" and accepts only an apology. Bill believes that being a nicer person will grow on Brooke's heart, where he feels he belongs.

One day [[Hope Logan]] announces to Ridge, Brooke and Liam that her father [[Deacon Sharpe]] is back in her life. Ridge is horrified because Deacon is a reminder of his wife [[Brooke Logan Forrester]] having sex with her own son in law. He hates thinking about this scandal and worries that Deacon will make a play for his wife. He demanded Hope to move out from the property if she wants to still see her father, but Brooke said it's not happening. Ridge, frustrated with Brooke having Deacon visiting Hope, he pays a visit to his daughter's home where he meets his ex wife [[Taylor Hayes|Taylor Hayes.]] He is surprised and happy to see her. Taylor becomes his confidant. Their daughter [[Steffy Forrester]] saw her parents sharing a hug and being friendly with one another and she starts encouraging her father to be with Taylor instead of Brooke. 

On New Years Eve Ridge can't make it home so Brooke is alone and already very tipsy which is because Sheila switched the labels on the bottle of win she ordered, unbeknownst to her. Deacon visited with Hope, Liam, their children and Brooke earlier and returns to the house, Brooke tells him that she wants to drink. He tells her not to but she does anyway. They start talking and then they start reminiscing about the past and they share a kiss. Brooke is horrified and hides it from Ridge. She has no idea why she relapsed not knowing that [[Sheila Carter]] exchanged her non alcoholic champagne with the real thing. Ridge learns that Brooke started drinking again and decides to be there for his wife. He takes Brooke to an AA meeting to be supportive to her. His daughter Steffy is annoyed when Ridge doesn't know if he will have time for a family dinner with her, Thomas and Taylor because of Brooke. When his children again encouraged him to leave Brooke, he snaps at them and firmly stands by Brooke. When they leave, he has a conversation with Taylor. She offers him, her help and confesses to him that she couldn't be in LA for so long because of Brooke and because she couldn't stop thinking about how their life would be if [[Sheila Carter]] wouldn't have shot her in 2001. Ridge embraces a very sad Taylor. Soon Steffy and Thomas again starts saying negative things about his marriage to Brooke, but he shuts them down saying that he feels that he can fix things because this is how marriages work. 
After that he went home to his wife Brooke and told her that there is nothing that can make him leave her while Steffy eavesdrops at the door. Ridge & Brooke embrace, without Ridge knowing that Brooke is still holding a secret from him. Steffy followed Ridge home and started questioning him and Brooke, wanting to know what is wrong with Brooke. She then invites Ridge again for dinner, but he wants to stay with his wife. Brooke tells him that she will be ok so Ridge decided to go to his daughter's home and then Thomas and Douglas arrive shortly behind him. 
Douglas says that he hopes that his mom, Hope is not upset with him and then proceeds to tell his dad, Thomas, Ridge and Steffy that he went to Brooke's on New Years Eve to retrieve his stuffed bunny and saw Grandma Brooke kissing Santa. Ridge jokes about it and says that it's one lucky Santa. Soon after Douglas tells Thomas that it was not Santa, but Deacon, after being prompted by Thomas to remember more about that night. Thomas reveals this to Steffy and the two of them obtain proof of Brooke's kiss with Deacon by illegally getting footage from her security system using [[Charlie Webber]] to do the dirty work. They see Deacon leaving in the morning and they assume that the two had sex and they tell their mother [[Taylor Hayes]] about it. Ridge is unaware of all this happening and he keeps on helping his wife to recover and even says that seeing how she acts at her AA meeting makes him love her more, even though she once again, betrayed him and kept it a secret from him. Steffy texts her mom to come to her house immediately. When she gets there, she tells her of Brooke's  "betrayal" and shows her the proof she illegally obtained, in order to get proof of Brooke kissing Deacon.

Soon thereafter, Taylor calls Ridge to their daughter's home and tells him that his wife kissed another man, Deacon on New Year's Eve and has been keeping it a secret since then. Ridge doesn't believe her and leaves to go home to talk to Brooke who had already texted him to come home because she was going to tell him the truth but Taylor beats her to the punch. After hearing her the truth from Brooke, Ridge tells her he has to leave. He goes straight to Deacon and greets him with a punch. The fight escalates from there and they get into a brawl in the supply closet of where he works and sleeps, destroying the room. Ridge accuses Deacon of spiking Brooke's drink that night so he could get her into bed during the fight but Deacon denies it all. Brooke goes there also after Taylor, her husband's ex-wife  stopped by with an impromptu visit to confront her about knowing the "truth" about that night, When she gets there and sees them fighting, she screams for them to '''STOP!''' and Brooke tells Ridge that Deacon "didn't do a thing" and that it was her that got them to stop fighting and blames herself for New Year's because she doesn't know why she drank in the first place. Ridge tells Brooke that he can't do this anymore and leaves her standing there in the supply closet with Deacon. She screams for him to not leave but he does anyway and she starts crying after he leaves. 

== '''Another triangle with Brooke and Taylor''' ==
Brooke goes home and is greeted by Hope and Liam, and they ask her what happened and where was Ridge. She fills them in and worries that Ridge may never come home again. She keeps calling him but he doesn't answer his phone but unbeknownst to her or even Ridge, Thomas gets his father's phone and deletes the messages from Brooke and then after he and Steffy keep trying to convince Ridge to turn his back on Brooke and divorce her and to give their mother another chance at a life for their family, he says he has to get some air and goes outside while Steffy continues to try and persuade him to stay with his family and their mother Taylor. While this is going on, Brooke has already headed over to Steffy's when she can't reach Ridge and is worrying what all Steffy, Thomas and Taylor are filling Ridge's head with and wants to talk to him. When she gets there, she sees Ridge's car and as she approaches the house, Thomas blocks her from going up to the door. He tells her that Ridge doesn't want to see her after her kiss with Deacon. When she can't get around Thomas, she decides to call Ridge again to tell him that she's outside Steffy's house but discovers that Thomas has Ridge's phone. She gets upset and after arguing with him, decides to leave and go home to wait for Ridge to come home. When she gets there, Hope and Liam are still there and she explains what happened over at Steffy and what Thomas did. After talking for a while, Brooke asks Liam to go over to Steffy's and talk to Ridge for her. After she leaves, Steffy comes outside to check on Thomas and he tells her that Brooke had just been there and what he had done with their father's phone and that he stopped Brooke from going up to the door and going inside. They talk about Brooke for a few minutes and then decide to go back inside. While they were outside, Ridge continued to talk to Taylor and told her how tired he was of Brooke not being faithful to him and turning to his enemies, Bill and Deacon. She tells him how much she's always loved him and that she still does. He tells her that he wants to come home and she asks him if he's sure because she can't be hurt by him again and he tells her that he is sure. They kiss and then Steffy and Thomas sees them as they come back inside the house and are overjoyed that their family is together again and that they got rid of Brooke, once and for all from their father's life and had reunited their parents. Then they all hug. Next, they go upstairs to continue kissing and discussing their future together. Downstairs, Steffy and Thomas are both gloating over the fact that they have finally beat the Logans. Then Liam comes inside the house and says he's there to see Kelly and Steffy becomes suspicious, telling him that she told him that Kelly had a play date today with a friend and then asks him what he's really doing at her house. He breaks down and admits that Brooke asked him to come over and talk to Ridge but they tell him that that isn't possible because Ridge has went back to their mother. Ridge spent the night in Taylor's bedroom however he didn't share her bed and decided that he will be living in Steffy's guest house. It was clear that Ridge still didn't make up his mind as he didn't start any divorce proceedings. Both Taylor and Brooke were eager to be with Ridge and fought for him. Ridge and Taylor got closer after their daughter and son in law were shot. Finn was pronounces dead and their daughter was fighting for her life in the hospital. Once Steffy woke up Brooke pleaded with Ridge to come back home, but he said that Steffy is his main priority and continued to live with Taylor, Steffy and his grandchildren in the [[Spencer-Forrester cliff house]]. After Steffy went back home her memories started coming back one day when she saw Sheila. She told Ridge and Taylor that Sheila was the one who shot her and Finn. Steffy, Taylor and Ridge called he police and organized an ambush. Sheila thought that Steffy wants to give her a chance to be in her grandsons life, but in reality Steffy confronted her and once Sheila confessed the police went out of their hiding and took Sheila in. Sheila confessed to Ridge that she was the one that spiked Brooke's drink on New Years Eve and that his son Thomas knew, but kept it a secret so he and Taylor would have a chance. After Ridge heard it he and Taylor decided to keep Thomas's involvement a secret from Brooke and Ridge moved out to Eric's house. Even with Sheila behind bars Ridge still had a lot on his mind as he was torn between the two mothers of his children and was worried for his grieving daughter. Steffy went to France and took her children because Taylor encouraged her to get away from all the painful memories. Both Taylor and Brooke visited Ridge at Eric's and were bickering with each other over him. Brooke told Ridge that she won't allow Deacon to come to their property which made him happy. When Sheila escaped jail Ridge was worried for both Brooke and Taylor and was relieved that his daughter and grandchildren are out of the country and Sheila can't stalk them. One day he saw that Brooke broke her ankle and decided that it's time to go home to his wife and try to make things right. Brooke was ecstatic, but Taylor was disappointed and gave Ridge a speech about Brooke always hurting him and turning to another man. Ridge felt bad about hurting Taylor, but went back to Brooke. When Ridge heard that Steffy checked into a mental facility because she can't cope with losing Finn he and Taylor went straight to Monaco. When Ridge and Taylor arrived in Monaco they got a call from [[Bill Spencer Jr.]] and [[Finn Finnegan|Finn Finnegan.]] They were over the moon when they heard their beloved son in law is in fact alive. Finn met up with his parents in law in Monaco and they all searched for Steffy. Finn was lucky and found Steffy by the church where they happily reunited. Ridge and Taylor were happy to see their daughter and grandchildren back with Finn, but Ridge's joyous moment was stopped when Taylor showed him a photo that his step daughter [[Hope Logan]] posted online. It was a photo where she was together with Brooke and Deacon at Forrester Creations. Ridge felt deceived which lead to a kiss between him and Taylor. Soon Ridge, Taylor, Steffy, Finn, Kelly and Hayes were back in LA. Ridge and Taylor entered Brooke's home together. Ridge kissed his wife and acted like everything is normal while Taylor was watching them and didn't tell her about the kiss when she asked him about his time in Monaco. Brooke realized that Ridge had to see the photo with her and Deacon that Hope posted and he admitted that he did. Brooke explained that she didn't invite Deacon to Forrester Creations, but she admits that she should leave the second he arrived. Ridge didn't want to talk much about it, but instead he said that what matters is Steffy having her life back. After his conversation with Brooke Ridge met Taylor in Forrester Creations and they discussed Monaco.    

Ridge and his family heard from a detective that [[Sheila Carter]] has died. Ridge, Taylor, Steffy and Thomas ended up talking about it at Forrester Creations. Suddenly Steffy revealed that she knows about Ridge and Taylor's kiss. She and Thomas both started encouraging the two to go back to each other. Steffy called Taylor the love of Ridge's life. After that they also discussed that [[Douglas Forrester]] should stop living with [[Hope Logan]] and [[Liam Spencer]] and come back living full time with [[Thomas Forrester|Thomas Forrester.]] Shortly after this conversation Ridge decided to tell his wife Brooke about the kiss that he and Taylor shared in Monaco. Brooke wasn't happy, but she decided to forgive Ridge because of her own past mistakes. The two celebrated it with a kiss and Ridge went to inform Taylor and Steffy about coming clean to his wife. Steffy started demanding from her father to leave Brooke and go back to her mother. She reminded Ridge about all the men Brooke was involved with including the men that she was with when Ridge and Taylor were married. Ridge defended his wife saying that she forgave him for a lot as well, but according to Taylor Ridge's mistakes weren't as bad as Brooke's. When Steffy left her parents to talk Taylor told Ridge that she feels like their history has been erased and asked him if he is really happy with Brooke. It wasn't  long before Ridge's children encouraged him to leave Brooke once more and Taylor, encouraged by Steffy and Thomas again had a talk with Ridge. Taylor asked him about Brooke and he replied that he is with his wife because she loves him. Taylor started to convince Ridge that Brooke will cheat on him again and reminded him that she mistreats  [[Thomas Forrester|Thomas]] by trying to keep him from being a full time father to his son [[Douglas Forrester|Douglas.]] Ridge just embraced Taylor and left. When he arrived Hope he saw Brooke in [[Bill Spencer Jr.|Bill Spencer's]] arms and had flashbacks of Taylor's words about Brooke. Ridge wasn't thrilled and suggested to Bill that it would be best if he wouldn't come over to their house again. Bill replied by telling Ridge that he has an incredible woman and encouraged him to now "blow it". Brooke explained that it was an innocent hug and and Ridge said that he doesn't want to see Deacon or Bill in their home. Brooke explained that he is the man that she will always love and they kissed. Ridge's wife made it clear that she is aware that a lot of forces tried to keep them apart. Brooke said that she won't let anyone destroy their relationship and she called Ridge her destiny. Another day Ridge spoke with Thomas who tried to convince him to go back to his mother. Ridge explained that he loved his wife and asked him to stop. Thomas thought that his father went back to Brooke out of pity, but Ridge said that it's not the case. Thomas reminded Ridge that he lives with his mother at Steffy's in the past, but Ridge disagreed and said that he was living in the guest house and that they didn't spend any night in the same bedroom. Thomas said that all of this doesn't matter because every time he and Taylor are together is special and asked him why did he go back at Brooke's. Ridge again reminded Thomas that Brooke is his wife, but his son replied by saying that he doesn't love Brooke as much as he loves Taylor. Steffy called Thomas and asked him to come over to her home. Thomas convinced Ridge to follow him there. When they arrived Steffy, Finn and Taylor were waiting for them. Steffy and Thomas started to talk about wanting their parents back together and how great they are when they are united. Steffy said that she knows that the love is there and they need to stop wasting time. Naturally Thomas backed her up on this. Finn added that he see's what Ridge and Taylor's kids see as well. Taylor agreed that she still love Ridge and that they have their own unspoken language. Ridge told his children that their mother makes him happy, but their situation is complicated. Thomas and Steffy replied by saying that all Brooke does is let him down. Taylor asked her children to stop wishing for the end of his father's marriage. Ridge thanked her for it. He had no idea that while he was spending time with his children, son in law and ex wife Brooke prepared a romantic dinner for him. When Brooke called Ridge's phone Steffy saw it and instead of telling her father that his wife is calling him she answered it and told Brooke that Ridge is with them. She refused to hand the phone to him and when Brooke reminded her that she's Ridge's wife Steffy replied "not for long" and started to talk about her parents spending time together and enjoying each other's company. Steffy told her step mom that she can see how much her father loves her mother. Brooke said she doesn't want to debate and just wants Ridge to come home as soon as possible, but Steffy replied by saying that Ridge is in his real home where he belongs. After that Steffy hanged up the phone on her. Thomas got worried that Brooke could come to their home, but Steffy said that she doesn't care and they have to get rid of Brooke once and for all.
